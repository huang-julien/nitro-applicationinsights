# `create$fetchInterceptor`

Return an object for a `$fetch` request. This util allows to track a request as dependency.

If an event is passed as argument, the request will be tracked as a children dependency of the event.

## Parameters

- event: **type**: `H3Event`

## Return values

See [ofetch interceptors](https://github.com/unjs/ofetch?tab=readme-ov-file#%EF%B8%8F-interceptors)

- `onRequest`: Set the traceparent header
- `onRequestError`: Track the exception if the request fails
- `onResponse`: Track the response as dependency
- `onResponseError`: Track the response as a dependency failure

## Simple example

```ts
import { defineEventHandler } from "#imports"
import { create$fetchInterceptors } from "nitro-applicationinsights/runtime"

export default defineEventHandler((event) => {
    return $fetch('/dependency', {
        ...create$fetchInterceptors(event)
    })
})
```

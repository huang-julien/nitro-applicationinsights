# Importing Application Insights in your project

Because Applicationinsights is written in CommonJS, there's currently some bug in dev or build mode.

When you need to import `applicationinsights` in your project, prefer using `#applicationinsights` instead.

Also avoid using `import * as` when importing `applicationinsights` or `#applicationinsights`, this will import everything from `applicationinsights` and Rollup will try to inline all files from `applicationinsights`. This will result into a faulty build.

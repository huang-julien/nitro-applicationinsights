## Install it on your project

1. Add the module to your dependencies

::code-group

  ```bash [npm]
  npm install nitro-applicationinsights
  ```

  ```bash [yarn]
  yarn install nitro-applicationinsights
  ```

  ```bash [pnpm]
  pnpm install nitro-applicationinsights
  ```

::

2. re-export the plugin within your plugin directory

`plugins/applicationinsights.ts`
```ts
export { default } from "nitro-applicationinsights"
```

3. ⚠️ Change your nitro configuration

The nitro plugin needs to be transformed. You need to inline it when re-exporting it.
This issue will be solved once `nitro-applicationinsights` becomes a nitro-module.

#### How to do it ?

To inline nitro-applicationinsights plugin you need to add to `externals.inline`.

```ts
export default defineNitroConfig({
    externals: {
        inline: ['nitro-applicationinsights']
    }
})
```

# Migration

## From 0.x to 1.x

### Moving to Applicationinsights 3 and Opentelemetry

See [Microsoft applicationinsights documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/azure/azure-monitor/app/opentelemetry-nodejs-migrate?tabs=upgrade) for changes from applicationinsights 2 to 3.

See [nitro-opentelemetry](https://github.com/huang-julien/nitro-opentelemetry)

- `H3Event.$appInsights` has been removed in favor of Opentelemetry Span.
- `applicationinsights:trackError:before` has been removed.
- `applicationinsights:context:tags` has been removed. You can use `H3Event.context.span.setAttributes()` instead.
- `applicationinsights:trackRequest:before` has been removed. You can use `otel:span:end` nitro-opentelemetry hook instead.
- `applicationinsights:trackError:before` has been removed. You can directly hook into the error hook from nitro instead.
- You need to wrap all your event handlers with `defineTracedEventHandler`. See [event handlers](/guide/event-handlers)
